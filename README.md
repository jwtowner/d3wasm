_d3wasm_ is a port of the Doom 3 video game to WebAssembly, with a full WebGL renderer backend.

The goal of _d3wasm_ is to demonstrate the power of WebAssembly, while bringing the idTech4 engine to the web.

This particular fork of d3wasm has been modified to allow building with Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 on Windows 10 + WSL2 + Ubuntu 20.04 using the Clang Windows Subsystem for Linux Platform Toolset. See BUILD.md for build instructions.

Enjoy!
